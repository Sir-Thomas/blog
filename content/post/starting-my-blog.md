## My First Attempt

My fist attempt at a blog was to write html and css from scratch. While it was cool to learn, I got burnt out pretty quick. It took a long time to make anything look good and was difficult to manage. I stopped working on it because it was too much work and I didn't care to do it all.

After a while, I realized I would never be able to make myself continue with the blog if I had to do it all manually. I had to find something that would allow me to make posts with as little effort as possible. I knew that I did not want to use a CMS like Wordpress because they go too far in the other direction.

I have messed around with Wordpress in the past and it just does way too much. I don't need most of the features and they just end up getting in the way. I will be the only one that posts to this blog and I just want it to be a very basic site.

## Hugo

Eventually I decided to look into Hugo. There are many reasons why I think it will be better. First, I will be able to start from a template and so much of the work will be done already. Second, Hugo allows me to write blog posts in a very simple markdown format. Third, it will be very simple to host my website on github pages.

With that in mind, I got started working on the blog. I followed [this](https://flaviocopes.com/start-blog-with-hugo/) tutorial which walked me through the basics. How to start a new project, import a theme, and host it on github.
